# Train-Schedule-App

All aboard my Train Administrator app! If you've ever fantasized about scheduling trains and wondering when the next train arrives then you've found the right place. This app was designed to flex my firebase and moment.js abilities by storing the train data so it loads up on the next use. The times of arrival and minutes till the next train are generated through moment.js after being passed through the database via snapshot. Feel free to mess around with it, though occasionally I'll go through and clear out the database to keep it clean. I'll continue to update these as I get stronger with moment and firebase and add in more features. Feel free to reach out to me at crhodes2146@gmail.com

PS, "Thomas the Tank Engine" gets special treatment in this house (dont you forget it!). 
Choo choo!
